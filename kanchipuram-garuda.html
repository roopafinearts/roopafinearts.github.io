                <p>The world famous Kanchipuram Garuda Sevai - where the Perumal is taken around in procession during the Garuda Sevai Utsavam.</p>
          <p>Some 450 years back, one devotee by the name of Doddayacharya lived in the temple town of Sholingar and was engaged to Lord Narasimha. He was very attached to Varadar of Kanchipuram. He never used to miss the Garuda Sevai of Devathirajan during Brahmotsavam. One year due to advanced age was not able to make the trip to Kanchipuram. </p>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-12">
              <div class="sigma_box m-0">
                <p>He was disturbed and on the day of Garuda sevai got up early in the morning and had his bath in Thakkan kulam (local pond in sholingar) and the archaryan expressed his inability by standing on the banks of the pond and visualized the Lord in Garuda vahanam in all its glory. In five sanskrit verses, known as Devaraja Panckajam he described how the Lord, carried by son of Vinathai would appear at the entrance of the huge tower of Kanchipuram temple, in all elegance and eagerness to protect his devotees.</p>
              <p>At that time in Kanchipuram, the Perumal was about to leave the temple. The temple priest received a divine message that our Lord would like to disappear from their midst for a couple of minutes to appear before Doddayacharyar in Sholingar. To commemorate this event, even today, our lord is hidden from public view for a minute. Later on a temple was built on the banks of thakkan kulam. At this temple Garudan is seen with upadesa muthirai.</p>
              <p>On the ninth day of the Brahmotsavam, Varadaraja is taken round in a palanquin, known as Andolikai. He is alone in the palanquin, without His Nachimars. Usually people have an interesting interpretation for this trip of the Lord — during His outing the previous night on the asva vahana, with His Consorts, He lost a ring and is now going out to look for it, without telling anyone, not even His Consorts. But this seems too superficial an explanation. The Lord is not looking for something as trivial as a ring. He is looking for lost cetanas, wrote scholar D. Ramaswamy Iyengar. He hides His Supremacy, so as not to frighten people, and this is shown symbolically by the shawl covering Him. As people approach Him without fear of His Supremacy, He reveals Himself fully, and wins them over. Andolikai is mentioned by Desikar in his Varadaraja Panchasat.</p>
